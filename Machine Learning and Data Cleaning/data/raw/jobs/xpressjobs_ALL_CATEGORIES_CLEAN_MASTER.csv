Wycherley is built on an Edifice of great values.
The mention of the name “Wycherley” rings many nostalgic memories far and wide. Wycherley International School was founded on January 7th 1985. It was a time when everybody felt the need to get back into a good system of English Education. The location was that of Dr. R . L Spittel’s “Wycherley Nursing Home” at 232, Bauddhaloka Mawatha, Colombo 7. Hence the Management decided to retain the name” Wycherley” for the school too.

On the 7th January 1985 the school commenced operation with just around one hundred students and an Academic and Office Staff of about forty. Initially the classes that set the school on the map of the Country’s Educational System, were only from the Nursery up to Grade 8.

Simplicity has always been the tradition at Wycherley. The very first day of establishment was signalled only with the lighting of the traditional oil lamp.
In September 1986 when the new Academic Year commenced, the School too showed signs of growing. The classes were now stretched up to Grade 12 so much so, that as it touched its first anniversary, the number on roll shot up to 450 students, which naturally entailed an increase in the Staff Cadre.

As numbers kept growing, in September 1988 Grade 9 to 12 were moved over to the location at No. 5, Queens Road, Colombo 3. This move created greater space and scope for the development of the Junior School and the High School.
The Junior School saw its growth in the setting up of two parallel classes for each Grade. The High School set up Laboratories, one for Chemistry and Physics and the other for Botany / Zoology/ Biology and Human Biology. Libraries were set up at both sections of the school.
By the end of 1988, the numbers had soared to 800 students. This necessitated the setting up of three parallel classes for each Grade.
The Foundation of Wycherley is built on Tradition, Simplicity and Discipline. “Success through discipline” is what Wycherley always aims at. The Principal has always had a vision to make Wycherley a truly “National School” illustrative of the Global Village Concept.
When Wycherley reached the ten year milestone in 1996, the population touched a thousand. The name of Wycherley has always been kept shining with excellent London Ordinary Level and London Advanced Level Examination results. Wycherley follows the Cambridge System of Examinations based on the British Educational System.

When the world heralded the “New Millennium” in 2001, Wycherley had reached its fifteenth anniversary. The school has forged ahead with a concept of racial and religious harmony which is cemented by a common medium of instruction- English. Recently a Don at Cambridge remarked “We need more students from Wycherley” and that speaks volumes for this hallowed institution.
The School has now come under the umbrella of a new management. The many changes in the infrastructure, modifications of the school and the greater thrust into the Cambridge System of Curriculum from the Primary Level onwards, opens new vistas for the students as they progress, heading towards higher education. The students will have choices of entry into foreign Universities and diverse fields of specialisation.
Wycherley is committed to making a better and brighter future for children who are in her hands. With DISCIPLINE, TRADITION and a CULTURALLY NURTURED International School, the students will go into the World to build a well chiselled and disciplined society. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7",https://xpress.jobs/jobs/view/253230/sales-executives-colombo-dehiwala-gampaha--wycherley-international-school-pvt-ltd,Sales,sales executive,2026-02-08
